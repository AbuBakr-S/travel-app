## Weather - Application for UK
In this project, I've decided to adjust the application for UK use. This involved changing the user's zip code to a postcode value as well as changing the units to metric, as here in the UK we use celcius to measure the temperature. However, the openweathermap api only accepts the first part of a postcode, for example "SW1" for "SW1 1AA".
